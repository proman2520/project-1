# project1-2023

This Git repository represents the work done by group 7, the Code Crusaders. The Images folder contains visuals made by Christopher,
while the Outputs folder contains figures made by Andrew. The Resources folder has a text file that contains instructions which 
detail who answered which questions and the limitations of the dataset. It also contains our .csv that we used to do our data analysis.

The rest is fairly intuitive: andrew_work.ipynb is the coding work done by Andrew, chris_work.ipynb is the coding work done 
by Christopher, and Joseph Y - Project 1 Code.ipynb is the coding work done by Joseph. Moises's analysis was done in Excel. 

Project 1.pdf is a pdf of our slides, although the slides can also be accessed below through link sharing.

Thank you for grading our project and if there are any questions or doubts, reach out to Andrew to have them resolved.
